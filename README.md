This is a template generator for Robot Framework Testing for an embedded project, or can be generalised to other projects as well.

Executing the generate_template.sh script creates all the required general directory structure.

The template focusses primarily on the test/qualification_tests directory for the stutoring of the robot tests.

The only needed file for the template generators are the  ones inside the Templates directory, README.md and project_dir_structure.txt. Rest of the directory structure can be deleted.
The structure will be recreated when the template generate script is run.
