This is a template generator for Robot Framework Testing for an embedded project, or can be generalised to other projects as well.

Executing the generate_template.sh script creates all the required general directory structure.

The template focusses primarily on the test/qualification_tests directory for the stutoring of the robot tests.

The only needed file for the template generators are the  ones inside the Templates directory. Rest of the directory structure can be deleted.
The structure will be recreated when the template generate script is run.
